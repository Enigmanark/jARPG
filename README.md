# Old Project Evermore
This is a project I worked on years ago. It's intended to be an open world RPG with old zelda style combat with a quest system. I have since
moved on to recreating the project in Unity, as that is a lot more feasible. However to not waste all the effort I put into this I am now 
making it open source under the GPL.
